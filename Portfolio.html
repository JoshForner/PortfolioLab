            <p>Below is some projects I worked on</p>
            <p>The decision making lab is a simple project that asks for your name and a number between 1 - 100. After it gets that information it then goes through if statements to tell you whether the number is even or odd. It also includes verifaction to check whether what the user entered is a number in the range.</p>

            <p>The Countries lab contains a small table of countires asking the user to select one of them. It will then display some information about that country, while doing things like changing the color of the text. It contains verifaction to make sure the user enters a correct index number and not things that are out of bounds or not numbers.</p>
