    <p>I grew up and graduated in Allendale. I played soccer and lacrosse. After attending Allendale, I went to Grand Valley State University for a year. </p>
    <p>I like to play video games with friends. I also like to hike and camp with friends. I have been camping many different places such as the Grand Tetons and Sequoia National forest.</p>
    <p>I was one of two children. I am the oldest with a younger sister, who I am very close with. </p>
